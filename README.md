# SCAD-JS-ESM

SCAD JS fork converted to ES modules.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by many other projects: [farrellm/scad-clj](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj), [OpenJSCAD.org](https://openjscad.org/), [tasn/scadjs](https://github.com/tasn/scadjs) and more... And of course it would not even exist without [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org) itself.
